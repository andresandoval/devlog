# 🧠 DevLog – My Daily Findings as a Developer

Welcome to my digital lab notebook. This repository is a collection of things I’ve discovered, fixed, or built
throughout my journey as a software engineer and tech tinkerer. It includes:

- 🐧 Linux setups and troubleshooting
- 💻 Driver issues and hardware configs
- 🚁 DIY projects
- 🔧 Code snippets and tools
- 📚 Tips, tricks, and solutions I don’t want to forget

Everything is written in Markdown and organized by date for easy reference — like a personal blog or digital garden.
